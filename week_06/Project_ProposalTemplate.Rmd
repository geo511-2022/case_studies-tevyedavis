# Inspiring Examples

Include links and screenshots (or embedded images) of a few (~3-5) example graphics found on the internet that convey what you want to do.  Include a few sentences about why you selected each link.

## Example 1

The graphic uses proportional circles to depict the number of covid 19 cases.

## Example 2    
![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/577688426b8f5b89f05b23f0/1585612766454-93MBNO1T15Y39QXT6C6J/Screen+Shot+2020-03-30+at+5.44.32+PM.png?format=2500w)


The graphic uses a choropleth map which is shaded with graduated colors to representuses the number of covid 19 cases.


## Example 3
![](https://www.ny1.com/content/dam/News/2020/05/18/gfx_covid_by_zipcodemapvo051112221201544png)

The graphic uses a choropleth map and also has an option to change layers to represent different data.

# Proposed data sources

# Proposed methods

library(tidyverse)- clean or format the data, plot maps and graphs.
